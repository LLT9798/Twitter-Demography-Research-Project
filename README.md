# Twitter_Demography_Prediction

This project focuses on finding proper mechanisms to detect Twitter user's **gender & age** data.        
Twitterâ€™s current policy does not require users to reveal any personal information, however, user demographic data is valuable for various business purposes.

The repository includes two notes: 
  1. Twitter API Streamer (Tweepy) [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  2. Pre-processing & Modeling (scikit-learn, DistilBERT)
