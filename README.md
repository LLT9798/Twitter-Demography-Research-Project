# Twitter User Gender & Age Detection

This project focuses on finding proper mechanisms to detect Twitter user's **gender & age** data.        
Twitterâ€™s current policy does not require users to reveal any personal information, however, user demographic data is valuable for various business purposes.

The repository includes two notes:
