# Twitter_User_Gender_Age_Prediction

This project focuses on finding proper mechanisms to detect Twitter user's **gender & age** data.        
Twitterâ€™s current policy does not require users to reveal any personal information, however, user demographic data is valuable for various business purposes.

The repository includes two notes: 
  1. [Twitter API Streamer ](https://github.com/LLT9798/Twitter_Demography_Prediction/blob/master/Liam_TwitterApp.ipynb) (Tweepy)
  2. Pre-processing & Modeling (scikit-learn, DistilBERT)
